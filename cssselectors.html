    </h1>
    <p>
        instead of giving tag name in selector.css we can give anthor prefixes like if we give
       <h2 class="html">
         1. * as prefix and then inside {} we can give color .THEE SPECIALITY WITH THIS PREFIX IS THAT WE CAN GIVE DESIRED COLOR TO ALL THE TEXT

       </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1 id="abc">
            for id the prefix is # and after that we can give the name here it is abc
        </h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h1 class="def">
            for class we use . as prefix then we can give the name here it is "def"
